	<p>The talks are:</p>
	<ul>
    <li><p><b>8th of November at 15.00pm CET:</b> <i>Experiences from a cryptographer</i> by Elette Boyle.</p>
		<p><i>Elette Boyle</i> is the Director of FACT Research Center, a senior scientist at NTT Research and an associate professor at Reichman University (IDC Herzliya), Israel. She received her Ph.D. in Mathematics at MIT, under the guidance of Shafi Goldwasser (and Yael Tauman Kalai). During 2013-2015, she was a postdoctoral researcher at the Technion Israel Institute of Technology, hosted by Yuval Ishai. During summer 2013, she was a short-term postdoc at Cornell University (Cornell Tech NYC), hosted by Rafael Pass. Before MIT, she completed her undergraduate work in math at Caltech. Her research interests include cryptography, computer security, coding theory, algorithms, and other areas in the foundations of computer science. Her awards include an ERC Starting Grant, Google Research Award, and Best Paper CRYPTO 2016.</p>

    <li><p><b>15th of November at 11.00am CET:</b> <i>Non-malleability and Universal Composability of zkSNARKs</i> by Chaya Ganesh.</p>
		<p><i>Chaya Ganesh</i> is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Automation at Indian Institute of Science. Before joining IISc, she was a post-doctoral researcher in Aarhus University, and prior to that she received her PhD from NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. Her research interests are broadly in Cryptography and Security. More recently, she is exploring efficient zero-knowledge proofs and rational cryptography. She has won the IBM global university award, Google and Protocol labs research grants, Infosys Young investigator award and Intel Rising Star Faculty award. She helps co-organize Bangalore Crypto day.</p>

		<p><i>Nina Bindel</i> is a researcher at SandboxAQ, CA, USA, located in Germany. Before, she has been affiliated to the Technische Universität (TU) Darmstadt as a post doctoral researcher in the cryptoplexity group led by Marc Fischlin. Until early 2022, she has been affiliated to the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) as a post doctoral fellow at the Department of Combinatorics & Optimization at the University of Waterloo (UW) in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. She has been a research visitor at the lattice program of the Simons Institute at UC Berkeley in spring 2020 and she interned at Microsoft Research, Redmond (US), during the summer 2019. Before, she was a post doctoral researcher in the Cryptography and computer algebra group at TU Darmstadt, Germany, where she received her Ph.D. in September 2018 under the supervision of Johannes Buchmann from TU Darmstadt.</p>

    <li><p><b>29th of November at 11.00am CET:</b> <i>Making and breaking post-quantum cryptography from elliptic curves</i> by Chloe Martindale.</p>
		<p><i>Chloe Martindale</i> is a Lecturer at the University of Bristol doing research on post-quantum cryptography. Her main research interests are in constructions and cryptanalysis of isogeny-based schemes, and,  more generally, cryptography with foundations in number theory. Dr Martindale also works on the dissemination of scientific knowledge through her work in reviewing future standards as part of the crypto panel of experts for the CFRG and through public engagement at schools and public science events. Before coming to Bristol in 2019, Dr Martindale was a postdoc at Eindhoven University of Technology in the group of Prof. dr. Tanja Lange, and she did her PhD at Leiden University and Bordeaux University under the supervision of Dr Marco Streng.</p>

  <h2>First Workshop: Women & Allies in Cryptography Discussions</h2>
  <h3>Birds of a Feather Event during <a href="https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2024/" target="_blank">Eurocrypt 2024</a> in Zürich, May 2024</h3>
  <h4>Event Description</h4>
  <p>
    Durng the “Women & Allies in Cryptography Discussions", we aim to provide a space that brings together different groups to discuss different topics related to <i style="color:purple; font-weight:500;">diversity in cryptography</i>. Each group gathers around a table that will be guided by a senior researcher, allowing participants to discuss and collaboratively brainstorm different ideas on a shared board. The event will conclude with each table presenting key discussion points and potential strategies for improving diversity in our community.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal of this event is threefold:
  </p>

  <ol start=1>
    <li> to <strong style="color:purple;">Gather</strong> people who advocate for improving the diversity in the cryptography community,</li>
    <li> to <strong style="color:purple;">Listen</strong> to the perspectives from those who suffer from the lack of diversity in our community,</li>
    <li> to <strong style="color:purple;">Brainstorm</strong> ideas on how to address the raised issues as a first step for a concrete plan of action.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    One of the motivations of this event is extending the activities of the Women in Cryptography (WinC) community to in-person spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    We welcome suggestions about discussion topics. You can send your ideas by email to <a href="mailto:contact@womenincryptography.com">contact@womenincryptography.com</a>.
